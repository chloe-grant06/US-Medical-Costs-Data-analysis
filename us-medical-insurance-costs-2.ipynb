    " Within this project, I aim to perform some analysis on data concerning U.S. Medical Insurance Costs. Furthermore, this project is a tool for me to put my Python skills into practice. I will be showcasing my knowledge of lists, loops, functions, dictionaries and so on here. We are told that this data contains no missing elements so no editing of the data is needed. Let's first begin by having a look at the dimensions of the dataset and seeing what variables it contains. "

    "- The average person has 1 child (the statistic showing a value slightly greater than 1). Having children could have an impact on medical charges as some people become more cautious when they're a parent which might lead to less medical charges for accidents. This is something we can look at by comparing the average medial charges for people with children and without. \n",
